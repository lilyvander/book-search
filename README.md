Book Search Engine
Introduction
As an avid reader, you're always on the lookout for new books to add to your reading list. This repository provides you with a book search engine where you can easily find and save books that pique your interest. Whether you're searching for a specific title or exploring new authors, this search engine has got you covered.

Features
Search for Books
Upon loading the search engine, you're presented with a menu offering options to search for books and to login/signup.
You'll find an input field to enter your search query and a submit button to initiate the search.
If you're not logged in, entering a search term will display several search results, each featuring a book's title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site.
Login/Signup
Clicking on the Login/Signup menu option brings up a modal with a toggle between login and signup options.
If you choose Signup, you'll be prompted to provide a username, an email address, a password, and a signup button to create your account.
Opting for Login presents you with inputs for an email address, a password, and a login button.
Account Management
Upon successful signup, your user account is created, and you're logged into the site.
When logged in, the menu options change to Search for Books, an option to see your saved books, and Logout.
Entering a search term while logged in displays search results with the option to save a book to your account.
You can view all the books you've saved, each displaying the book's details and a button to remove it from your account.
Clicking on the Logout button logs you out of the site and returns you to the initial menu.
